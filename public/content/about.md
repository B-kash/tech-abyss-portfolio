# About Bikash Chapagain

I'm **Bikash Chapagain**, a full-stack software developer and systems consultant based in Leuven, Belgium. I help businesses across Belgium and Flanders build complete web applications through full-stack development, from frontend interfaces to backend APIs and infrastructure.

## What Problems Do I Solve?

I specialize in solving these common business problems:

- **Need for complete web applications:** I build full-stack web applications from frontend interfaces to backend APIs and infrastructure using TypeScript, React, Node.js, and modern best practices
- **Integration challenges:** I develop full-stack solutions to connect frontend interfaces with backend systems, streamlining workflows and user experiences
- **Technical debt and maintenance:** I help refactor legacy systems, improve code quality across the full stack, and establish maintainable development practices
- **Infrastructure inefficiency:** I optimize cloud infrastructure (GCP, AWS), CI/CD pipelines, and automation workflows to reduce costs and improve performance
- **Lack of full-stack expertise:** I provide consulting and development services to teams that need full-stack development support across frontend, backend, and infrastructure

## Technical Expertise

I work with modern technologies to build reliable, scalable full-stack applications:

**Frontend Technologies:**
- React, Angular, Vue.js
- TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML, CSS
- Modern UI/UX patterns and responsive design

**Backend Technologies:**

## How I Work

I follow a structured approach that ensures problems are understood, solutions are well-designed, and outcomes are clear. I start by understanding your business context and technical constraints, then architect full-stack solutions that balance immediate needs with long-term scalability. I implement using modern technologies and best practices across the entire stack, and I deliver with documentation and knowledge transfer so your team can maintain the solutions independently.

If you're facing full-stack development challenges, need a complete web application built, or want to enhance existing systems, [contact me](/contact) to discuss how I can help.
